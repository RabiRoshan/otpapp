# otpapp

My client wanted an app that sends otp to his customers directly from his mobile phone instead of using proivders like BulkSms. This is a  flutter app which automatically send OTP to users registered on his website, directly from the device. Both the app and website are synced with firebase realtime database.

## To run this app:

Register app to your firebase and save the `google-services.json` as shown in <a href ="https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android#create-firebase-project">https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android#create-firebase-project</a>
